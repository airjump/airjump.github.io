## Welcome to my Project - Page

### Preamble

I will try to document everything here in English. The goal is to share my knowledge with many in the community. The project should be an attempt to illuminate the aspect of security and to gain experience around the topic of networks and Linux. The best way to contact me is through Twitter: [@airjump](https://twitter.com/airjump)

### Project - Description

------------------------------------------------------

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/airjump/airjump.github.io/edit/master/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown
Syntax highlighted code block

# Header 1
## Header 2
### Header 3

- Bulleted
- List

1. Numbered
2. List

**Bold** and _Italic_ and `Code` text

[Link](url) and ![Image](src)
```

```markdown
def foo():
    if not bar:
        return True
```

For more details see [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/airjump/airjump.github.io/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
